 Project Description:
  We will be using a Recipe API to create a grocery list. User will be able to search an item and pull up a recipe for that item. The user will have the option to add all ingredients from that recipe to the grocery list. 
  They will also be able to add and delete personal items to the grocery list.
  The user will be able to send their grocery list to someone via messages for the implicit intent.
  The user can save recipes and those will be added to the SQL Database as well as the grocery items.
  
  The three acitivites will be:
    -grocery list
    -view recipe
    -view saved recipes
